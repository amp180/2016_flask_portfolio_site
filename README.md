# Flask-Portfolio-Site

The source code of my old portfolio site.
It's written in python, flask and js.
It ran on a shared webhost as a cgi script.
It also had a small blog, a javascript/svg clock, an ip checker and a tool to check what labs in DCU were free.
It also had a meme generator as an easter egg, credit to @ConorDavenport for the template.
